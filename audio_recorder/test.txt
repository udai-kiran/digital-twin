[6.17s] The whole Sagittarius.
[12.67s] A star. 15 million miles wide within mass of four million stars.
[12.67s] So, keep it.
[19.04s] That's it for my Galaxy.
[19.04s] But don't let the picture fool you.
[19.04s] The black face, so it's invisible.
[25.41s] be dressing towards this object that's millions of miles wide.
[25.41s] It can never see it.
[25.41s] You can only ever see it.
[31.79s] the light's rolling around its edge and its face twisting and tearing as the pose everything in.
[38.16s] Such a chair is a star, it was known as a super-missive book.
[44.56s] that those are sort of a fan favorite,
[44.56s] but they're really just one of many different types
[44.56s] of black all that is.
[50.95s] We've been covering Black Falls for decades at New Scientists.
[50.95s] We've published.
[57.32s] So much about black holes.
[57.32s] So today we're putting together everything
[57.32s] or experts know about these.
[63.70s] to use a terrifying act of physical object.
[63.70s] Part of the reason why we love black.
[70.12s] all the same white sisters are so fast-nated with them.
[70.12s] It's because that kind of were all a best series of...
[76.49s] 6. Great. Grat things them. Really understanding them. We'll require us to pay for
[76.49s] over the contracts of.
[82.91s] physics that exists today. We require to reconcile quantum mechanics and gravity and it will.
[89.30s] requires to understand space time like we've never understood it before.
[89.30s] This also does something...
[89.30s] ...peanies!
[95.65s] Cheers and bow back holes until you can't really see.
[95.65s] Maybe we can't hear these invisible.
[101.98s] objects collide over billion my years away.
[108.38s] something, so we evacuate into nothing. So I hope you join us as we go
[108.38s] bit deeper.
[114.79s] The closer you look, the more exciting things we come.
[114.79s] Some dark holes were ready to burn ourselves in the unit.
[0.00s] diverse and still in its infancy.
[0.00s] Others might be baby black holes.
[0.00s] Let's go from them.
